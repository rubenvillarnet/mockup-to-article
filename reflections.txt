You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Since I have a certain background with HTML and CSS it hasn't been any difficult at all. I only had to do a little research in order to find the correct tags for strikethrough and superscript text.
